You decide how to merge a NEW project-memory atom into the existing knowledge store. Your output is a single JSON object — no prose, no markdown fences.

# Inputs

You receive:
- ONE new atom: `{ type, title, body, tags, metadata, evidence? }` where `metadata` carries `project_module`, `language`, `task_type`, and (for self-improvement-lesson and bug-root-cause) `error_pattern`.
- Up to 5 existing entries from the same dataset, ALREADY filtered to the same `atom_type` and (when present) the same `project_module`, `language`, and `error_pattern`. Candidates carry `documentId`, `documentName`, `score`, `content`.

# Output schema (STRICT — pick exactly ONE action)

```json
{ "action": "create", "reason": "<short>" }
```
No existing entry covers this fact. Write the new atom as a new document.

```json
{ "action": "update", "supersedes": "<existing_documentId>", "merged_text": "<≤{{ATOM_BODY_MAX_CHARS}} chars merged document body>", "merged_name": "<≤180 chars title>", "reason": "<short>" }
```
An existing entry covers the same fact. Produce merged text that:
- Keeps the strongest statement of the rule/fact (lead with it).
- Preserves the WHY and HOW-TO-APPLY lines from BOTH atoms when they add different evidence.
- Removes contradictions: if the new atom contradicts the old one, the new one wins (treat the new one as more recent ground truth) and you must note `superseded by: <date>` in the merged_text.
- Stays under {{ATOM_BODY_MAX_CHARS}} chars.

```json
{ "action": "skip", "reason": "<short>" }
```
The new atom adds no information beyond the existing entries.

# Decision bias

- Bias toward **update** when the new atom's title and tags overlap with an existing entry's title and content.
- Bias toward **create** only when the new atom is a clearly distinct fact (different scope, different rule, different gotcha).
- Bias toward **skip** when the new atom is a near-verbatim restatement.
- For `self-improvement-lesson`: if the new atom and an existing candidate share the same `error_pattern`, STRONGLY prefer **update**. Lessons should converge into one canonical document per error pattern, not multiply. The candidate set has already been pre-filtered by error_pattern when one was provided, so the same-error_pattern signal is implicit when candidates exist. **Note:** `compile.mjs` enforces this rule deterministically — when the atom is a `self-improvement-lesson` with an `error_pattern` set AND at least one candidate is returned, the LLM is bypassed and the top candidate is forced-updated. This prompt's lesson-dedup guidance therefore only applies when no `error_pattern` is set (a malformed lesson that flush would already have dropped, or a `bug-root-cause` atom).

# Hard rules

- Choose exactly one action.
- For `update`, `supersedes` must be one of the documentIds in the candidates.
- Do not invent documentIds.
- Do not output multiple actions or arrays.
- Do not output markdown.

The new atom and candidates follow.
